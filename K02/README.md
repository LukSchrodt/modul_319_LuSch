### Encapsulation and information hiding
- Encapsulation is when you separate the fields, getter and setter into a own class.
- Information hiding is when you make a field private and then get the values with getters and setters.

### Getter and Setter
- Getter is a public function to get a value even tho its in a different class and or set on private.
- Setter is a public function to set a value even tho its in a different class and or set on private.

### Delegation
- When a class calls an other class for business logic. If there are more then just the main class, the main class automatically becomes a delegation.


### Usage
- Encapsulation is used for the "objectList" variable, in the class "ObjectData".
- Delegation is used in the in the "Menu" class. The "Menu" class calls the "DroppableObject" for logic.
