### Inheritance
Inheritance creates a hierarchy between different classes in java. Also child classes can extend their parent class. This allows them to get the attributes of their parent class.

### Abstract Classes
An abstract class is a non functional method. This means that the method itself does not need to work, but you can implement or extend it from an other method which allows to  use the parameters of the abstract class.

### Interface
This is a blueprint of a class. It tells the class what to do and what not. The difference between Inheritance and Interfaces is that interfaces do not tell the class how to do something just what to do.

### Polymorphism(Overriding, Overloading)
Polymorphism means that a child class can modify the parent class methods. This is done with the annotations **@Override** and **@Overload**.
- @Override: This overrides a method with the same name. The method body does not need to be the same and it can fully override the whole method.
- @Overload: Overloading is if a method has the same name but different arguments. Depending on the arguments a different method will be called.
